                My Love,
                First of all, I would like to thank you. We've only been together for a month, but it feels like I've already gained so much knowledge about love—about how lovely it is to have someone like you in my life. 
                Thank you for being you, for making me happy, for your sweetness, and for all the little things you do that make our relationship special.It may seem minor, but to me, 
                it was unbreakable because I was spending time with you. Each second I spend with you makes me understand more and more how blessed I am to have you.
                I want you to know how much I love you—not just because of the happy days, but because of everything that makes you who you are. The way you laugh, the stories you share, 
                the warmth of your presence—it all means the world to me. You have brought so much light into my life, and I can’t imagine my days without you.
                 this is not only about one month.There will be more months, years, and hopefully, a lifetime filled with love and care for you. I don’t know what the future holds, 
                but there’s one thing I am sure of—I want to spend every chapter of my life with you.I love you so much, Macy Biason. Happy first monthsary to us! ❤️

                With all my love,
